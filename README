In this highly competitive multiplayer game, players enter a 3D cube (approx. 2 x 2 x 2 m) on each side of which colors
are floating. Each color defines a territory owned by a player.

The aim of each player is to expand his territory as much as possible.
This is achieved when the indicated gestures are performed properly and fast.
Visual output as well as gesture recognition are the basic characteristics of this installation.
